{{< about_split name="Ayham Layous" role="Managing Director" image="/images/ayham.jpg" >}}
I am the Managing Director and a state-authorized accountant with a master’s degree in Economics and Accounting, and solid experience in accounting, financial management, and advisory services. I work in an analytical and structured way, and I focus on accounting that creates real value — not just compliance, but a practical management tool for better control and decision-making.

Quality, accuracy, and predictability are central in everything I do. I work closely with clients to ensure clear oversight, healthy finances, and confident decisions, and I’m known for being accessible, direct, and solution-oriented.

To me, great accounting is about trust, professional strength, and long-term collaboration.
